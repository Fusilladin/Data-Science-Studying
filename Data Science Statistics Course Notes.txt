parameter = data set coming from total population
statistic = data set derived from sample set of population

sampling frame = list of individuals from which a sample is selected from

simple random sampling (SRS): a population subset selected in a way that every sample size of 'n' form the population has an equal chance of being selected

Strata: distinct subgroups

Stratified sampling = separate population into distinct groups and then select simple random sampling from each strata

Systematic sampling: take a sample on every specific instance

kth = every so many
    every 3rd or every 5th member of a population

cannot do systematic sampling when things are already in a pattern, but can when the population sample is ordered random

problems with cluster sampling: sometimes the people located in the cluster are all similar in a way that makes the problem hard to study because of other outside factors

Cluster sampling: sample based on geography. Biased toward the type off people living in the area.

Convenience sampling: using data or result that are readily available. There is bias in every group. often miss important subpopulations. severely biased results.

Multi-Stage sampling: combination of sampling strategies layered in strategies
    1. cluster sample of states
    2. simple random sample of counties
    3. stratified sample of school
    4. stratified sample of classrooms

Basic Guidelines for Planning a Statistical Hypothesis:

--Hypothesis & Variables:
1. State a Hypothesis
2. Identify the individuals of interest
3. Specify the variables to measure

--Sampling, Ethics, & Data Collection
4. Determine if you will use the entire population or a sample
    - if you choose a sample, choose a sampling method
5. Address ethical concerns before data collection (IRB board)
6. Collect the data

--Analysis & Reporting
7. Use descriptive or inferential statistics to answer your Hypothesis
8. Note any concerns about your data collection or analysis
    - Make reccs for future studies (in science, usually peer reviewed literature report)

Experiment vs Observational study:

Experiment: a treatment or intervention is deliberately assigned to the individuals. Purpose is to see the possible effects of the treatment on measured variables

Observational: observations of individuals are taken, but no treatment or intervention occurs.

Non-response and voluntary response: if many people refuse your survey the people who complete it are likely to have a biased opinion. There may be a reason to not complete the survey probably has to do with the topic

Truthfulness of response: respondents may lie on purpose.
    - if asked too personal questions
    - if asked too difficult a question
    - may accidentally lie (recall bias)

Hidden Bias:
    - question wording may induce a certain response
    - order of questions
    - scales of (1-5) may not always represent accurate responses

Interviewer Influence:
    - interviewer has verbal and non-verbal Influences
    - best to have same population as research participant

Vague Wording:
    - avoid vague terms in a survey
        - instead of a long time, use number or a specific timeframe (10 minutes)
    - sometimes are stuck using vague terms
        - use grounding language (definition) so people are led in the same direction with thought before answering

Lurking Variable:
    - lurk means to sneak around
    - a variable that is associated with a condition, but may not cause the condition
    - more education typically means higher income, but not always

Topics in Randomization:

Reasons to randomize:
    - to assign individuals to treatment subgroups
    - helps prevent bias in selecting members for each group
        - distributes 'lurking variables' evenly

Placebo Effect:
    - when these is no real treatment, but participant assumes they're receiving treatment and responds favorably
    - placebo is given to a control group
    - used as control or comparison group
    - 'Attention Controls' fake experiments where you can't tell if it is real or not

Blocked randomization:
    - sometimes concerned about lurking variables being disproportionate, so you evenly distribute groups into two blocks or people (gender blocks)

Blinding:
    - where a person is not told of a treatment assignment in a study so they're not biased in reporting information for study
    - Double-Blind: means that both the participant and the staff do not know the treatment assignment

Frequency Histogram & Distribution:

Frequency Histogram:
    - A specific type of bar chart
    - helps identify the distribution of the data

Relative Frequency: The proportion of the relative example size for each class

Steps to Draw a Frequency Histogram:
    1. Make a frequency table
    2. Draw a vertical line for the y-axis (frequency of ___)
    3. Draw a horizontal line for the x-axis (class/group labels)

Distributions:
    - A line shape made around the histogram bars

Types of Distribution:
    Normal: mound shape and symmetrical (more in the middle)
    Uniform: Mostly straight across line
    Skewed Left: Light on the left (higher on the right)
    Skewed Right: Light on the right (higher on the left)
    Bimodal: mode (meaning high point), similar to normal, 2 mound peaks with a really large space

Outliers:
    - Data points that are further out than the main part of data.

Cumulative Frequency:
    - You add on the previous frequency to the next one so they are also higher than the previous

Time Series, Bar & Pie Graphs:

Time Series:
    -Made of measurements for the same variable for the same individual taken at intervals over a period of time
    - Need time series data, one measurement per time series
    - Good for measuring trends over time

Bar Graph:
    - horizontal of vertical
    - uniform spacing
    - frequency histograms are bar graphs that
        - must have a quantitative variable on x-axis
        - must have a freq or rel freq on the y-axis
    - clustered bar graph: multiple bars per each section
    - hash marks or squiggle to see the data
    - pareto chart: shows the freq of things and sorts based off of freq, with a line that adds all of them together over the course of the bars

Pie Chart/Circle Graph:
    - used to count things that are mutually exclusive
    - yes or no
    - 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5
    - % and/or the frequency

Measures of Central Tendency: Mode, median, mean

Central Tendency
    - can only be about quantitative Data

Mode
    - Number that happens the most common
    - possible to have no Mode
    - possible to have more than one Mode

Median
    - middle of the data
    - halfway in the middle
    - Median for 2 numbers you find the average

Sigma (Σ): "Sum of ___"
    - Σx is pronounced 'sum of x'
    - Σ is used a lot in stats

Mean (Average): Σx/n
    - Σx = sum of x
    - n = number of values in your data
    - after summing up all of the x's you divide by n

    x-bar (x̄):
        - sample statistic
        - use lowercase n
        - x̄ = Σx/n
    mu (μ):
        - mean coming from a population
        - use uppercase N for population size
        - μ = Σx/N

Weighted Average:
    - Have different things count more or less on mean
    - multiply each subgroup by the percentage of its weight
    - 4.0*0.2 + 3.0*0.3 + 3.5*0.5 = 3.45

Central Tendency & Skewed Distributions:
    - Normal Distribution: mean, median, mode all appx the same
    - Skewed Distribution: are not the same, slightly different
        - mode (lowest), Median, Mean (highest) -> right skewed

Measures of Variation:

Range:
    - difference between the max and min
    - range is not very useful

Variance & Standard Deviation:
    Variance: How much data can vary
        - how well does the mean represent the spread of data
    Standard Deviation: How much the data deviates around the mean

Sample Variance: squared
    - s^2 = (Σ(x-x̄)^2)/(n-1)

Sample Standard Deviation: square root
    - s = √((Σ(x-x̄)^2)/(n-1))

Sum of Squares: top part
    - find x's
    - find x̄ (sum of x's divided by number)
    - x - x̄ =
    - square the numbers
    - sum all squares up

Variance Formula: bottom part
    - number of x's - 1
    - sum of squares / n-1

Standard Deviation Formula (σ):
    - get square root of answer

Coefficient of Variation (CV):
    - shows how much the data varies compared to the mean
    - always a %
    - Sample CV = s/x̄ * 100
    - Population CV = σ/μ * 100

Chebyshev's Theorem:
 - 1 - (1/k^2)
 - gives minimum amount of proportion which is in a standard deviation of a mean
 - gives a range of answers, not exact answer
 - empirical formula
    - 1 SD is 68%
    - 2 SD is 95%
    - 3 SD is 99.7%
 - k cannot equal 1 so, start with 2 SD's
    - 1-(1/2^2) = 1-(1/4) = 3/4 = 0.75
    - therefore at least 75% of the data lies between 2 SD's of the mean
    - 2 SD is 75% (minimum)
    - 3 SD is 88.9% (minimum)
    - 4 SD is 93.75% (minimum)
    - actual number can be higher
- k = (x-μ)/σ   (x minus the mean, divided by standard deviation.)
    - x=μ+k*σ
